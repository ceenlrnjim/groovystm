A groovy library/dsl for using clojure's STM in groovy/grails applications.
this is just a thin layer of syntactic sugar on top of the java objects that implement the clojure language.
Not all concepts implemented here map exactly the their clojure namesakes.

Note, it is highly recommended that you understand how to use the objects in clojure first
